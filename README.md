I opted for Gulp to serve as my task runner in my project workflow. I made this choice because Gulp offers a robust and flexible automation solution that aligns well with the needs of my development process. Additionally, I made the deliberate decision to employ SCSS alongside vanilla JavaScript for this project. This combination not only facilitates a smoother development experience but also streamlines the process of automating builds and monitoring changes during development phases.
